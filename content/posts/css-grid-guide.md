CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that makes it easier than ever to create complex, responsive web layouts. In this guide, we'll explore how to use CSS Grid to build modern, flexible designs.

## Why CSS Grid?

CSS Grid provides a two-dimensional layout system, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously. This makes it perfect for creating complex layouts that would be difficult or impossible with other CSS layout methods.

## Basic Grid Setup

Here's how to create a simple grid container:

```css
.grid-container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
	grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
	gap: 20px;
	min-height: 100vh;
}
```

## Grid Template Areas

One of the most powerful features of CSS Grid is template areas, which let you name grid areas and place items using those names:

```css
.layout {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-areas:
		'header header header'
		'sidebar main aside'
		'footer footer footer';
	grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 200px;
	grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.header {
	grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
	grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
	grid-area: main;
}
.aside {
	grid-area: aside;
}
.footer {
	grid-area: footer;
}
```

## Responsive Grid Layouts

CSS Grid makes responsive design intuitive with features like `auto-fit` and `minmax()`:

```css
.responsive-grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
	gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a responsive grid where items wrap to new rows when the container gets too narrow.

## Practical Example: Card Layout

Here's a complete example of a responsive card layout:

```html
<div class="card-grid">
	<div class="card">Card 1</div>
	<div class="card">Card 2</div>
	<div class="card">Card 3</div>
	<div class="card featured">Featured Card</div>
	<div class="card">Card 5</div>
	<div class="card">Card 6</div>
</div>
```

```css
.card-grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
	gap: 2rem;
	padding: 2rem;
}

.card {
	background: white;
	border-radius: 8px;
	box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	padding: 1.5rem;
}

.card.featured {
	grid-column: span 2;
	background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
	color: white;
}
```

## Advanced Grid Techniques

### Subgrid (When Available)

```css
.subgrid-container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}

.subgrid-item {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

### Grid Lines and Placement

```css
.item {
	grid-column: 2 / 4;
	grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
```

## Browser Support and Fallbacks

CSS Grid has excellent browser support, but for older browsers, you can provide fallbacks:

```css
.grid-container {
	/* Fallback */
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;

	/* Grid */
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}
```

## Conclusion

CSS Grid is an incredibly powerful tool for creating modern web layouts. Its intuitive syntax and powerful features make it easier than ever to build responsive, flexible designs that work great on any device.

Start experimenting with CSS Grid in your next project - you'll be amazed at how much easier layout becomes!
