**My Story**

Picture this: a curious 4th-year Computer Science student who started with a simple "Hello, World!" and fell in love with the magic of turning ideas into reality through code. That's me—a **frontend-focused full-stack developer** with an unshakeable belief that every problem has a solution, you just need to find the right approach.

**The Journey So Far**

My adventure in the world of programming began with a fascination for how websites work. What started as curiosity quickly evolved into passion when I realized I could create beautiful, interactive experiences that users actually enjoy. I discovered that **frontend development** wasn't just about making things look pretty—it was about crafting digital experiences that make people's lives easier.


There's something deeply satisfying about breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and then building elegant solutions that scale.

**Current Focus**

Right now, I'm diving deep into **Go programming** to strengthen my backend skills.

I'm working on projects that combine my React frontend expertise with Go backends, creating full-stack applications that are not just functional, but fast, scalable, and maintainable.
